# Early-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict three major diseases at an early stage using medical data: Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer. Early detection can greatly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates.

Machine Learning Models Used
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Logistic Regression
